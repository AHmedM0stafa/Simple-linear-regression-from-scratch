# Overview
Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique for predicting numerical values. It is widely used in various fields like finance, physics, and engineering, and is often the first algorithm that a machine learning enthusiast learns.

This implementation of linear regression is done using only NumPy and Pandas, which makes it easy to understand and customize.

# Description
The Simple Linear Regression code uses a basic machine learning algorithm to fit a line to a set of data points. In this case, the line represents a linear relationship between two variables, X and y. The algorithm finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances between the actual y-values and the predicted y-values. This is also known as the mean squared error (MSE).

# Requirements

+ gdown
+ Python 3.6+
+ pandas
+ numpy
+ matplotlib
+ scikit-learn "for Dataset"

# Installation
To install and use this implementation of linear regression, you need to have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and install the required packages.
OR ,try to use Colab.

# Usage
To use this implementation of linear regression, you need to have a dataset in the format of two columns, one for the input data 'X' and the other for the target values 'y'. You can use your own dataset or use the provided dataset 'challenge_dataset.txt'.
